                    Although we know that cats and babies can co-exist harmoniously in the same family, there are still precautions that new or expecting parents can take to help safeguard both baby and feline.                    </li>

                    Keep your cats indoors, and do not befriend neighborhood cats while pregnant! The feline parasitic infection toxoplasmosis can be caused by a cat eating small mammals or birds. This parasite in a pregnant woman can result in miscarriage, stillbirth or such birth defects as blindness, deafness, hydrocephalus or epilepsy.
Toxoplasmosis cysts are shed in the feces of infected animals. Since cats often use gardens as litter boxes, always wear gloves when gardening. Also wear gloves when washing raw vegetables and fruits, handling raw meat or scrubbing food prep surfaces, and avoid rubbing your eyes until your hands have been washed. It’s also best not to eat or feed your cat raw or undercooked meat. To prevent any cysts that are passed in the feces from becoming infectious, scoop fecal matter at least twice a day.

                    </li>
                    <li>When you first arrive home from the hospital, peacefully greet your cat in a quiet room without interruption. Once you've had a few minutes to reconnect, let in everyone else—partner, baby, grandparents, baby nurse and other well-wishers.</li>

                    Even without anemia, a nutritional imbalance alone could spur your pooch to gobble dirt. Eating dirt can be a sign that your dog isn't getting enough of the essential minerals they need for good health. Or, a hormonal issue could be preventing your dog from absorbing the minerals and nutrients in their food. Nutritional imbalances are very rare in healthy dogs, so make sure to talk to your veterinarian about choosing the best dog food for your pup.                    </li>
                    <li>Place a used receiving blanket or piece of infant-wear in a quiet area where the cat can investigate it. Make sure that the crib and other baby sleeping-locations are off-limits to the cat. A newborn cannot turn over or even move her head at first, so a heat-seeking cat who chooses to cuddle up close to the baby's face could make it difficult for the child to breathe. Close the door to the nursery when the baby is napping. If there is no door, either install a temporary screen door or place a crib tent over the crib to keep the cat out. These precautions also prevent the cat from urinating in the crib, something she may try if extremely stressed.</li>
